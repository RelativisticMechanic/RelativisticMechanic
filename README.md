### Hi there

I am Siddharth Gautam, a third year Chemical Engineering student at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela. 

Computers have fascinated me since the time I was introduced to them, at age 4. A Windows XP machine with the latest-and-greatest Pentium 4 and a solid 256 megs of RAM. So 2004! In my teenage years, I spent hours on Game Maker 8.0 and Visual Studio, writing little games and programs. I also got interested into Operating System development at one point and taught myself x86 assembly as well as the various aspects of low level programming from kernel design to task scheduling, file systems and device driver management. 

Currently, I'm pursuing Chemical Engineering, and my interest primarily lies in physics and mathematics - especially in the domain of computational physics. As chemical engineers, computational physics is a handy tool, with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) making its appearance from rocket engines to nuclear reactors. 

On the computing side of things, I'm pursuing a degree in Bachelors of Science in Programming and Data Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. 

I've programmed in Python, C++, C#, x86 assembly, JS. I'm also experience with tools such as Paint.NET, Blender, Unity and Godot.
